# CPP Module 00

![Final Score](https://i.ibb.co/DCtw70t/image.png)

## Project Description
The `CPP Module 00` is the first step in the C++ modules series at 42. It introduces fundamental concepts of C++ such as namespaces, I/O streams, and basic syntax differences from C. The goal is to build a solid foundation for object-oriented programming while adhering to strict coding standards.

## Journey
This module was my introduction to C++, and while the syntax felt familiar due to my experience with C, there were nuances that required adjustment. Initially, I struggled with the imposed coding style, especially the restriction on namespaces, which led to failing my first attempt. However, on my second try, I successfully adhered to the standard and completed the module efficiently.

## Key Learnings
- Differences between C and C++
- Understanding and using I/O streams (`cin`, `cout`)
- Basics of object-oriented programming
- Proper use of `std::string` and dynamic memory allocation
- Adapting to strict coding standards

## Technical Details
- Implemented a simple phonebook program to practice class structures and basic input handling.
- Explored memory management in C++ with `new` and `delete`.
- Learned about access specifiers (`public`, `private`) and their importance in class design.
- Avoided the use of forbidden features like namespaces.

## Project Status
- **First Attempt**: Failed (Namespace restriction issue)
- **Second Attempt**: Success
- **Completion Time**: 1 day per module

## Challenges Faced
- Adapting to new syntax and best practices in C++.
- Understanding and properly using class structures.
- Debugging segmentation faults caused by incorrect memory management.
- Avoiding common pitfalls such as using `std::endl` excessively, leading to unnecessary flushing.

## Reflection
Although this module was introductory, it set the tone for the rest of the C++ curriculum. The transition from C required a mindset shift, particularly in how memory and object-oriented principles are handled. The strict coding style helped enforce good habits that proved useful in later modules.

## Skills Developed
- C++ syntax and best practices
- Object-oriented programming basics
- I/O stream handling
- Debugging and memory management
- Adapting to 42's coding standards
